### 4. A/B Test
As part of this project, we collaborated with an online store's marketing department to develop hypotheses aimed at increasing sales. Using ICE and RICE, we prioritized the hypotheses based on their potential impact and identified the most promising one. We then conducted an A/B test to compare conversion rates and assess other relevant variables.
